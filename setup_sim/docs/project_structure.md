## Overview

This simulation framework is designed to mimic the complex physical processes underlying micro-electrical discharge machining (MicroEDM) at the nanoscale. It couples atomistic dynamics with phase transformations and nanoparticle formation while ensuring realistic thermal and mechanical behavior. The simulation is segmented into four major phases: Initial Setup & Equilibration, Spark Ablation, Nanoparticle Formation, and Analysis Methods.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Equilibration

### 1.1 System Definition & Geometry

- **Multi-Region Configuration:**
  - **Central Nitinol Workpiece:**
    - Modeled as a crystalline structure using a lattice that can accommodate phase transitions between austenite and martensite.
    - Validate structural parameters such as lattice constant, coordination numbers, and potential defect sites.
  - **Water Medium Surrounding the Workpiece:**
    - A bulk water region (using TIP3P, SPC/E, or a similar water model) provides realistic solvent effects.
    - Adequate padding around the workpiece prevents boundary effects and ensures a proper dielectric environment.
  - **Targeted Spark Region:**
    - A small, well-defined surface area is earmarked for energy deposition.
    - This area is chosen based on expected locations of energy input, and its size is optimized to capture the ablation process without compromising global energy conservation.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - **Periodic in x/y Directions:**
    - Ensures that the simulation mimics an infinite plane, reducing edge effects in the lateral dimensions.
  - **Fixed in z-Direction:**
    - Prevents unphysical expansion or contraction vertically.
    - Buffer zones are implemented to absorb any artificial heating or pressure fluctuations, thus stabilizing the simulation.

- **Size Optimization:**
  - Regions are scaled to balance computational cost against physical accuracy.
  - Ensures that critical phenomena (e.g., shock propagation, thermal gradients) are captured without requiring an excessively large simulation box.

### 1.2 Material Properties & Potentials

- **Nitinol Representation:**
  - **Interatomic Potentials:**
    - Utilize an EAM/MEAM potential framework that includes temperature-dependent behavior to capture the austenite to martensite transformation.
    - Lattice parameters are validated against experimental data, ensuring realistic thermal expansion coefficients and phase transition thresholds.
  - **Phase Transition Properties:**
    - The potential must accurately reflect changes in bonding and structure as temperature varies, ensuring that the simulated phase behavior (martensitic transformation) is physically sound.

- **Water Model Selection:**
  - **Model Choice:**
    - Models such as TIP3P or SPC/E are employed to simulate water, with long-range electrostatics computed via methods like particle–mesh Ewald (PME) to capture dielectric screening accurately.

    - Non-bonded interaction parameters are tuned to ensure realistic surface energies and solvation effects.

### 1.3 System Equilibration

- **Multi-Stage Relaxation Protocol:**
  - **Energy Minimization:**
    - A hierarchical minimization is conducted, progressively lowering force tolerances to relax high-energy configurations.
  - **Temperature Ramping:**
    - The system is gently heated from a baseline (e.g., 300K) to operational temperatures to avoid shock.
  - **Pressure Equilibration:**
    - An NPT ensemble is used initially to allow the system to adjust its volume and pressure, minimizing stress.
  - **Final NVT Stabilization:**
    - Once pressure equilibrates, the system is switched to an NVT ensemble to maintain a fixed volume and stabilize the thermal profile.

- **Validation Metrics:**
  - **Energy Conservation:**
    - Monitoring the total energy over time ensures no spurious energy input or loss.
  - **Temperature Stability:**
    - The temperature distribution is checked to be uniform, particularly at the interfaces between different regions.
  - **Structural Validation:**
    - Radial distribution functions and interface structure analyses are performed to confirm that the water and metal regions are correctly equilibrated.
